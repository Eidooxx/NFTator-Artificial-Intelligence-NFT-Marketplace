# NFTator-Artificial-Intelligence-NFT-Marketplace

## Project description
NFTator is an NFT Marketplace that users can generate, create, and mint NFTs with Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## How NFTator works?
NFTator users can create NFTs using AI by describing an art image (prompt) then it will be generated by Hugging Face. The generated image will be uploaded to IPFS, then a metadata link will be generated that is stored in the blockchain in ERC-721 standards contract. Users can also upload their art images then they will mint an NFT from the NFT creation contract. Users can list their NFTs with 0% fees the price of their NFTs will be in ETH as NFTator is deployed on the Sepolia testnet.
